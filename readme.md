## FloatzelSharp
### Note: this box is still in heavy development; proceed with caution!
A complete rewrite of Floatzel 2.x, now in c#. Also known as Floatzel 3.0<br>
### Installation instructions
None currently. Stay tuned for proper install instructions<br>
If you are upgrading from Floatzel 2.x: If you ran atleast Floatzel Java Version 2.4 or newer, 3.x will automatically detect the old RethinkDB Database used by 2.4 and onwards. It will convert data stored in it to the newer 3.x database as said data is required. Converting Floatzel databases which where created in update 2.3.2 or eariler (this includes SQLite and FloatzelDB) is not supported at the time being.
